# Password Complexity Españolizer

Remembering randomly generated passwords is too complex for most people, unless you use a password manager. 
Most people like to use passwords that are easy to remember. 
But brute force attacks tend to use traditional ASCII characters first. 
To slow down this type of attack, I created a small script that replaces some letters and symbols of traditional passwords with characters commonly found on Spanish keyboards.
Users can trust passwords they can easily remember, but hardened with Spanish special characters.
